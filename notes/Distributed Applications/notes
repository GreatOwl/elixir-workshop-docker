pg2 can allow us to access groups of processes by a common name.

pg2 is using tools from OTP to distribute messages in a cluster.

serialize writes through a single server to prevent race conditions.

global: provides a lock across the cluster so that no other process in the cluster can perform certain actions
    until the lock has been released.

node and process monitoring
    when pg2 is notified of a new member it merges groups and memberships.


there could be lock overhead if our groups contain large number of memberships
    - pg2 may not be your solution for these situations

pg2 is a distributed database
    - Available and partition tolerant
    - eventually consistent and will heal from partitions
    - conflicts are easilly resolved through merging
