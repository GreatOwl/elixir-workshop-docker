            - called channels

                    - missed messages, messages received are not persisted
                        -disconnected when going through the tunnel
                    - buffering
                        - ensuring messages received even if went through the tunnel
                    - reconnect
                        - seamless reconnection when exiting the tunnel
            - no additional dependencies (blah)
                - bloated feature set in the framework in my opinion
        - a protocol allowing full duplex communication over tcp
