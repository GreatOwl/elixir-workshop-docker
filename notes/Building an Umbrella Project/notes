    - Organize a project so its easy to delet code

What is an Umbrella Project?
    - mixfile
    - apps/ directory
    - OTP applications
        - a component that can be started and stopped and re-used by other apps
        - app dependencies
        - configuration
        - start stop behavier
        - regular applications and & library apps
        - standard
        ~ Application
            - Server/Service (correlation in OO)
                - or a Microservice ~ umbrella?


Building an umbrella
    - mix a new project
        - just a normal project
    - create a new mib project in "apps/"
        - mix will know automatically its an umbrella
        - This will contain business logic

        Ex. Entities in a Bank
            - Account ~ ledger entity
            - Entry ~ ledger entity
            - Customer
            ~ These all have different rates of change

            bank.ledgen.balance
            bank.ledger.write
            bank.create_customer

                -These are interactions/modules
    - umbrella apps need to be identified as in_umbrella: in mix file
    - add bank as dependency to a new web project
        - separation of concerns

    - new umbrella for admin app
        - setup different ports in development
            - phoenix is not your application

    - Deployment
        - Heroku
            - MasterProxy
        - distillery - first class support for umbrella projects

    - Auth
        - separate subsystem
            - upfront design
            - separate features
            - Separate Repo and separate DB
