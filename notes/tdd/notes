tools
    - exunit
    - and hound

organize your files
    - recommend match directory structure
    - break long test files into multiple files
        - break module tests for large files into pieces by placing a directory for the module
            - different files now have multiple files to test different functions in the module

    - if too much test data - library like ex_machina
        - generate factories to produce test data
            - should work with or with ecto
        - factories can act as documentation for models
            - yes factories for tests!
        - helpers are useful for setting up complex scenarios
            - can also be local
    - write acceptance tests
        - can tell you users story
        - provides you a suite of documented tests that tell you how users are expected to interact with your app

    exunit allows creation of custom assertions

    - TDD doesn't always make sense for experimental stuff
