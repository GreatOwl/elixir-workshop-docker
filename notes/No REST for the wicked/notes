absinth and graphql

sounds great for getting not necessarily for inserting...
I'm dissapointed that it gives 200 responses but a data structure for errors to connected clients.

REST
    Request
        - GET /users/1
        - Returns Response
            - links/references to associated resources
                - bad for mobile
                - so we serialize everything (barf)
                    - no longer an api resources
                    - instead an api of view resources
                    - results in client server contract
        - Basically untyped

Why graphQL
    - relationships and hierarchy
        - ask for specific data, and get exactly what you need back.
    - strongly typed
    - uses schemas and generate queries
        - inverts control flow
    - designed their own types/structs

    Graphiql
